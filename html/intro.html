<p>The Web has evolved into a Global Data Space <ref>Bizer2011_dataSpace</ref>. It has for a while now been the place of choice to manage a wide variety of private and public data <ref>Almeida2016_openHealth</ref>. In fact, the evolution of the Web towards this irresistible pull of a global computer is accelerating. If for no other reason because it now sustains the knowledge engineering process in most domains by defining its digital context. Among those, the Life Sciences represent not just a domain of application, but often also a place with invaluable architectural guidance about this emergent computational ecosystem. Accordingly, this volume is intended as a hands-on guide to those wanting to navigate, populate, and advance the computational ecosystem that define the WebComputer.</p>
