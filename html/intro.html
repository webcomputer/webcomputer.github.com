<h5>Evolving Web</h5>
<p>
    The Web has by now evolved to become the reference Global Data Space <ref>Bizer2011_dataSpace</ref>
    . It has for a while been the place of choice to manage a wide variety of private and public data, well suited even for sensitive data on human Health requiring consumer-facing applications <ref>Almeida2016_openHealth</ref>
    . In fact, the evolution of the Web towards the irresistible pull of a global computer is accelerating. If for no other reason because it now sustains the knowledge engineering process in most domains by hosting its digital context. Among those, the Life Sciences domain represents not just a domain of application, but often also a place with invaluable architectural guidance about the emergent computational ecosystem: the Web is evolving in ways not dissimilar to Biological Systems. Accordingly, this volume is configured as a hands-on guide to those wanting to navigate, populate, and, most of all, participate in the evolution of the computational ecosystem that define the WebComputer.

<h5>Health Sciences</h5>
<p>
    Web applications to the Life Sciences and, in particular, to Human Health are a uniquely suited to approach the WebComputer. Indeed, that much was anticipated by the inventor do the Web <ref>Lee_Inventor_W3C</ref>
    in his milestone paper in Science about, precisely, "<b>Creating a Science of the Web</b>
    " <ref>Lee_ScienceWeb2006</ref>
    . The Health Sciences are also something we all care about at many levels, from personal to societal, and covering a range of issues from access and governance to discoverability and adding value to research initiatives. As a result, by approaching the WebComputer from a Health Sciences angle we are also choosing a shared domain where being FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproducible) <ref>FAIR_Wilkinson_2016</ref>
    carries a value for the widest audience.

<h5>First dive into the full stack</h5>
The realization that the the web browser provides the full stack of tools needed for application development is the first step towards realising that we are at the edge of an era driven by code migration. 
The "full-stack" as is is commonly designated by software developers, indicates the availability of an environment with databases, background processes, module loading, code debugging and network monitoring.
All that and more exists, conveniently and safely sandboxed, within the ubiquitous web browser. Before we dissect each component and consider the distributed architectures that in now enables, best we dive into one of the demonstration applications of the OpenHealth project <ref>Almeida2016_openHealth</ref>.
This application will assemble itself in this book by injecting the code with the &lt;script&gt; element.
